## The Edge of Predictability

Chaos Theory isn't about randomness; it's about **sensitive dependence on initial conditions**. The Mandelbrot Set and the Logistic Map demonstrate that simple mathematical rules can produce infinite complexity.

### The Butterfly Effect Explained
In 1961, meteorologist Edward Lorenz rounded a number from .506127 to .506. That tiny difference—less than the flutter of a butterfly's wing—caused his weather simulation to predict a hurricane instead of sunshine.

This calculator lets you visualize that divergence.
*   **R-Values 1.0 - 2.9**: The system is stable. Populations settle into equilibrium.
*   **R-Value 3.0 - 3.5**: Period Doubling. The population bounces between two stable states (Boom and Bust).
*   **R-Value 3.56+**: Chaos. The pattern never repeats, yet stays within bounds. This is the "Strange Attractor."

### Where We See This in Real Life
*   **Heart Rate Variability**: A completely steady heartbeat is actually a sign of heart failure. A healthy heart has a chaotic, fractal rhythm.
*   **Stock Markets**: While trends exist, the micro-movements are governed by chaotic feedback loops of millions of traders.
*   **Dripping Faucets**: The rhythm of a leaky tap transitions from periodic to chaotic as the flow rate increases.
