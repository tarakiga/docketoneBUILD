It's **complexity**.\nA consistent 50dB Air Conditioner is easier to ignore than a variable 40dB conversation. The brain tries to \"decode\" the conversation, burning glucose, while it filters out the AC.\n\n### Sensory Gating\nNeurotypical brains have a \"gate\" that shuts out background noise.\nADHD brains often have a \"broken gate.\" Every sound enters with equal priority.\n*   The clock ticking.\n*   The lights humming.\n*   The fabric of your shirt scratching seeing.\nThis leads to rapid exhaustion (Sensory Overload).\n","faq":[{"question":"Why does silence hurt?","answer":"For some, pure silence is under-stimulating (under-arousal), causing the brain to generate anxiety to wake itself up.

It masks high-frequency distractions and is famously soothing for ADHD brains."},{"question":"Are noise-canceling headphones safe?","answer":"Yes, but don't wear them 24/7.
