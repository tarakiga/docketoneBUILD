## The Science of Emotional Support Dairy

When life gives you lemons, you make lemonade. But when life gives you **stress**, the only scientifically valid response is **ice cream**.

The **Stress-to-Ice-Cream Ratio (SICR)** is a critical metric for navigating modern life. Developed by our team of "Crisis Connoisseurs," this calculator goes beyond simple cravings. It uses advanced variables like "Work Deadline Proximity" and "Recent Breakup Status" to prescribe the precise dosage of dairy (or non-dairy alternative) required to return your dopamine levels to baseline.

### How It Works

Our algorithm considers three main factors:

1.  **Base Stress Level (BSL):** A quantitative measure of your current internal screamy-ness, rated from 1 (Chilling) to 10 (Nuclear Meltdown).
2.  **The Heartbreak Coefficient:** A breakup triggers an automatic biological need for high-fat, high-sugar comfort foods. We account for this with the "Chunky Monkey Protocol."
3.  **The Deadline Multiplier:** Stress induced by work requires "Fuel Ice Cream"—flavors that can be eaten with one hand while typing furiously with the other.

### Why Trust This Calculator?

Because guessing is dangerous. Undercut your dosage, and you're left staring at the ceiling at 3 AM. Overdose, and you're dealing with a brain freeze and a sugar crash. We provide the **Goldilocks Zone** of comfort.

_Disclaimer: This tool prescribes ice cream for emotional support, not medical treatment. If your stress is manageable only by industrial quantities of frozen dessert, please consider also talking to a friend or professional!_
