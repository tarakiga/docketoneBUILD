## The Mechanics of Dimension Hopping

Connecting Nether portals isn't magic—it's math. Specifically, it's a coordinate transformation ratio of **8:1**. For every block you travel horizontally in the Nether, you travel 8 blocks in the Overworld. This mechanic is the backbone of high-efficiency travel networks, allowing players to traverse thousands of blocks in seconds.

### Why Your Portals Don't Link
If you've ever built a portal in your base, traveled to the Nether, and returned only to spawn in a cave 200 blocks away from your house, you've been a victim of **Portal Drift**.

The game looks for the closest active portal within a 128-block radius (in the Nether). If your calculated coordinates are blocked by lava or netherrack, the game shifts the portal generation. To fix this, you must **manually sync** your portals:

1.  Note your Overworld coordinates (F3 key).
2.  Divide X and Z by 8 (Y coordinate acts differently—see FAQ).
3.  Go to the Nether, break the drift portal, and rebuild it at the *exact* calculated coordinates.

### Pro-Tip: The Y-Level Strat
While X and Z are strictly bound by the 8:1 ratio, the Y-level (height) is crucial for safety.
*   **Nether Ceiling (Y=120+):** Safest for transport hubs. Break through the bedrock for ghast-free travel.
*   **Lava Sea Level (Y=31):** Dangerous bridge building, but great for Ancient Debris mining.
