## The Raw Power of the Sky

A single bolt of lightning is a simplified breakdown of the atmosphere's dielectric resistance, releasing a colossal **1 Billion Joules** (approx. 278 kWh) of energy in a fraction of a second. To put that in perspective: your phone battery holds about 0.01 kWh.

### Why Can't We Harvest It?
If one strike could power a Tesla Model 3 for 900 miles, why don't we have lightning farms?
1.  **Intermittency**: Lightning is flashy but unreliable. You can't schedule a thunderstorm.
2.  **Voltage Overload**: A bolt carries up to 1 Billion Volts. This instantaneous surge would vaporize standard capacitors and transformers before they could store a single spark.
3.  **Capture Difficulty**: You'd need towers taller than the Empire State Building covering entire states just to capture a fraction of global strikes.

### The Math of Your Life
This calculator takes your daily consumption (average US household: 29 kWh/day) and pits it against the raw fury of Zeus.
*   **The Toaster Standard**: 1 Bolt = 100,000 slices of toast.
*   **The Gamer Standard**: 1 Bolt = 20 years of running a high-end RTX 4090 gaming PC (at full load).
