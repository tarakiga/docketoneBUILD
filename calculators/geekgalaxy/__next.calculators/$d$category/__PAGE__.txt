## The Rules of Temporal Mechanics

Time travel is messy. If you go back and change something, you risk breaking causality.

### The Major Theories
1.  **The Grandfather Paradox**: You go back and kill your grandfather. So you are never born. So you can't go back to kill him. So he lives. So you are born...
    *   *Result*: The universe crashes (or you just fail).
2.  **The Multiverse (Avengers/DBZ)**: Going back creates a *new* timeline. You can kill your grandpa, but you just return to a different future. Your original timeline is unchanged.
3.  **The Bootstrap Paradox**: You go back and give Shakespeare his own plays. He publishes them. Who wrote them? The information has no origin.
4.  **Frequency Sensitivity (Back to the Future)**: Time is like a river. You can throw a stone (save your parents' marriage) and the ripples change things, but the river flows on.

### 1.21 Gigawatts
This calculator checks your intended "Timeline Incursion" against these models to predict the most likely outcome: from "Stable Loop" to "Total Reality Collapse."

This tool converts the **Logistic Map** (the same formula as the Chaos Microscope) into sound waves.\n\n### What am I hearing?\n*   **The \"Thump-Thump\"**: At low values ($r < 3.0$), the math produces a steady, single value. This sounds like a metronome.\n*   **The \"Gallop\"**: At $r=3.1$, the value splits in two. You hear a *high-low-high-low* rhythm.\n*   **The \"Chord\"**: As divisions multiply (4, 8, 16...), the rapid oscillation creates a complex, textured tone.\n*   **The \"Static\"**: Once we hit Chaos ($r > 3.57$), the values are non-repeating. To the human ear, this creates White Noise (pure randomness).\n\n### Why Music?\nMusicians have used chaos math to generate melodies that sound \"human.\" A completely random melody sounds like trash. A completely repetitive one is boring. Chaos provides \"Structured Surprise\"—the essence of good jazz.\n","faq":[{"question":"Is this really music?","answer":"It's algorithmic composition. Artists like Aphex Twin and Brian Eno use similar generative systems to create evolving soundscapes."},{"question":"Can I use this for sampling?","answer":"Absolutely. The chaotic 'noise' makes for excellent snare drum textures or glitchy percussive backgrounds."},{"question":"Why does it sometimes stop making noise?","answer":"At certain high settings, the math can 'escape' to infinity or crash to zero if the starting parameters aren't balanced.
